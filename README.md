# Efficiently Handling Dropdown and Free Text Input into Database:
## Maintaining Data Integrity with Separate Tables

### Example 1. Add the input to the database if it doesn't exist:
If the input value is not found in the related database table, you can add it as a new record to the table.

**In example 1**, there is a problem to store with this process. If users give input slight spelling mistake or any garbage data or same meaning of different word then It will store too.

We can handle slight spelling mistake by using **Option a,** same meaning of different word by using **Option b** but can't handle for garbase data.

**Option a: Implement a fuzzy search or utilize techniques like string similarity:** We can use the Levenshtein distance algorithm to measure the similarity between two strings and determine if they are close enough to be considered the same. For Example:

    // If the item does not exist, perform fuzzy search to find similar items
            $similarItems = Item::whereRaw('LEVENSHTEIN(item_name, ?) < 3', [$itemName])
                                ->orderByRaw('LEVENSHTEIN(item_name, ?)', [$itemName])
                                ->get();

                            
**Option b. If any user use same meaning of different word:** Detecting synonyms for user input in free text can be a challenging task. One approach is to use external services like natural language processing (NLP) APIs that provide synonym detection features. For instance, some popular NLP APIs, like the ones offered by Google Cloud Natural Language API or Microsoft Azure Text Analytics API, offer the ability to identify synonyms or similar words for a given input.

### Example 2: Add a nullable column to main table: 
This column will store the selected option from the dropdown if the user chooses from the existing options. But if any free text is being input then it will store to the custom column.

## Other best approach to handle the situation:
The best approach to handle the situation where users can select a disease from a dropdown list or enter a new disease name as free text depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application. Below are a few considerations and possible approaches to help you decide:

**Dropdown List with Autocomplete:** Offer a dropdown list with autocomplete functionality. As the user starts typing in the dropdown, the list can dynamically filter and suggest matching diseases. If the desired disease is found, the user can select it from the list. If not, they can continue typing to add a new disease.

**Separate Table for Dynamic Diseases:** Create a separate table to store dynamic or custom diseases. This table can store user-entered disease names that are not part of the predefined list. When the user enters a new disease, save it in this table, and associate its ID with the prescription in the main table.

**Synonym/Alias Handling:** Implement synonym detection to handle cases where users might use different names for the same disease. For example, if "Headache" and "Migraine" are synonyms, the system can map both to the same disease ID.

**Fuzzy Matching:** Use fuzzy matching algorithms like Levenshtein distance or Jaccard similarity to find close matches for user-entered disease names and suggest existing diseases.

**User Confirmation:** If the user enters a new disease name, provide a confirmation step before adding it to the database. You can show similar existing diseases to the user and ask for confirmation to avoid duplicates.

**Data Validation:** Implement robust data validation to ensure data consistency and prevent incorrect or duplicate entries.

**User Feedback and Usability:** Consider providing feedback to the user about the selection process. For example, indicate when a user has selected an existing disease from the dropdown or when they are adding a new disease.

Ultimately, the best approach will depend on factors like the size of the disease list, how often it changes, the likelihood of users entering new diseases, and the importance of data consistency. Implementing a combination of techniques like autocomplete, synonym handling, and user confirmation can lead to an effective solution that improves the user experience and maintains data integrity. It's essential to thoroughly test the chosen approach to ensure it meets your application's specific needs and works seamlessly for your users.
